# Air-Quality-Lookup-GUI
This program allows you to lookup the air quality of a specific place given a date and the geographical coordinates of the specific location. The data for this program is taken from the OpenWeatherMap API and the GUI used was tkinter in python. The OpenWeatherMap API gives the specific air pollutant concentraion of a specific location for a specific date. The air pollutants given are: NO2, PM10, O3, and PM25. Given the concentration of each pollutant the air quality was determined by checking the concentration of each pollutant and returning the qualitative name for the corresponding air index. For example if the N02 concentration is greater than 400 Î¼g/m^3 than this would indicate very poor air quality. The date returned by the OpenWeatherMap API is a unix timestamp, so the datetime library in python was used to convert the date to datetime format.
